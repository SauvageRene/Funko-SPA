# Funko-SPA

Funko Collectors SPA. 

This is a SPA(Single Page Application)

The Funko collectors is an individuals collection of Funko Pops.
They can add or delete funkos as they wish. 
    currently working on adding a wishlist where they can add or remove from a wishlist. 
## Rails-backend
    The Rails backend was mostly created using scaffold
    you can achieve the server running by running "rails s"
    in the backend/funko-api folder. Rails S does not work unless you are in that folder. 

## JavaScript-Frontend
    We use fetch in certain javascript methods to get the funkos from the 
    backend and also the collection. We then use event listeners to render 
    these objects to the Index.html
